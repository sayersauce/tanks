# Tanks
Tanks is a multiplayer HTML5 browser game. This is a project I have worked on periodically with different iterations since 2018. It is currently far from being complete. The game is written in JavaScript both on the front-end and back-end. The game draws a lot of inspiration from [a game for the Nintendo Wii][tanks]. Eventually I plan to host this game on my website when it is in a more finished state.

## Structure
`/client` An [Express.js][express] app which hosts the client-side in-browser files.
